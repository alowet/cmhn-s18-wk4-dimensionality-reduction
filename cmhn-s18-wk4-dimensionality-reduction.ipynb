    "fMRI data often has a dimensionality problem: we get approximately 100,000 voxels (i.e., features) per volume, but only 100s of time points or trials (i.e., examples). This makes it very hard for machine learning algorithms to model how each voxel contributes.

This is done iteratively until an optimal set of features are found. Importantly, cross-validation is used during each iteration to select the best set of features at each stage. scikit-learn makes this incredibly easy with the method RFECV.
