Feedback:

Ex 2: Python has fast ways of sampling every nth point in an array, look into it.  
Ex 5: Your covariance matrix is the wrong size (45x45). Good job calculating the memory limits. It is a bit more complicated than just the final storage size of the matrix though.  
N: Congratulations! You figured out that the three clusters were different runs: no one else noted that! Well done

5/5
